This is a film box office prediction project. We tried to predict box office with multiple factors, using linear regression, KNN and neural network method. All the code was written in Jupter Notebook. 

data_fetch.ipynb: our code to fetch film data through OMDB open source package.
prediction.ipynb: main file, including the data processing, prediction process and result analysis 
film_data.csv: processed film data, the data we used in our prediction. Some factors have already been vectorized.
: our project report, including the introduction to the role of each module in data_fetch.ipynb and prediction.ipynb and our analysis on our prediction result.
